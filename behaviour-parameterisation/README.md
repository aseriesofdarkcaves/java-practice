# behaviour-parameterisation

Code and examples taken from the book _Modern Java in Action_ by Raoul-Gabriel Urma, Mario Fusco & Alan Mycroft.

Behaviour parameterisation is a software development pattern that helps with frequent requirement changes.

Most code in this module isn't really supposed to be executed, rather it illustrates various steps in getting to an
implementation of behaviour parameterisation which is fairly flexible. There are also no prizes for some of the class
names, as they're only used as containers for the various attempts.
